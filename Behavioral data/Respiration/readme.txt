AllVols, inidcating sniff inspiratory volumes

Each one of these variables are 33 (subjects) X 17 (rows), with each organized as:
Col 1-5: Preconditiong CSt, nCSt, nCSm, nCSs, CSs
Col 6-7: Conditioning CSt, CSs
Col 8-12: Postconditioning CSt, nCSt, nCSm, nCSs, CSs
Col 13-17: Postconditioning2 CSt, nCSt, nCSm, nCSs, CSs
